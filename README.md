# FitLit


### Learning Goals:
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed.
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.


### Abstract:

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- We used event delegation to run functionality on our dynamically-created HTML elements.

- We made our site nearly identical to the original comp.
