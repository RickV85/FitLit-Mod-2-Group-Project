# FitLit


### Learning Goals:
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed.
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.


### Abstract:
Tracking progress while going through your health and wellness journey can be difficult and complicated. Fortunately FitLit is here to save the day! Through this web app user data can be collected, stored, and displayed to the user in truly meaningfuly ways. By using FitLit you can track a users progress on important health aspects like step goals, sleep, and hydration while also being able to compare them to user averages for all three catagories.

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- Webpack, learning how to work with webpack while downloading a third-party extension and getting it to run with Webpack. 
- Fetching data while utilizing promises. Having to understand JavaScript execution context and the callstack in order to have functions call after the data has already been fetched. 
- Chart.js, learning how to utilize a third-party extension

Some wins included:
- Chart.js, we succesfully implemented the extension which allowed us to display user data in a meaningful way.
- Testing in Mocha and Chai, we feel that our tests and test data allowed us to accurately gauge how the code would perform when the website was active
