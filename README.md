# IdeaBox


### Learning Goals:
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- We used event delegation to run functionality on our dynamically-created HTML elements. 
- We cleaned up bugs that were displaying the incorrect arrays on the DOM. 

Some wins included:
- We changed our function which generated dynamically-created HTML elements, not hard-coded.
- We made our site nearly identical to the original comp.
